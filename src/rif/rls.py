"""Row-level security policy DDL, shared by the schema migration and tests.

The migrations under ``src/rif/piccolo_migrations/`` apply these policies to
the real database; ``tests/conftest.py`` applies them to ``rif_test`` when
building the test schema. RLS is the security boundary for this project, so
the two call sites must never be allowed to drift apart — a difference here
would mean tests validate policies that production does not actually enforce.
This module is the single source of truth both call through. (The oldest
policy migration deliberately froze its own snapshot instead: it runs before
``memberships.role`` exists, so today's predicates could not compile there.)

``NULLIF(current_setting('app.person_id', true), '')`` matters, not just a
bare ``current_setting(..., true)`` cast: a session where ``app.person_id``
was never touched returns NULL and denies as intended, but the principal
-clearing path (``set_config('app.person_id', '', true)``) sets a defined
empty string, not an absence, and ``''::uuid`` raises rather than comparing
false. ``NULLIF`` folds both cases to the same NULL, so both deny cleanly.

Reads and writes use different predicates, and each SQL command gets its own
policy. Reads accept any membership, so a ``VIEWER`` sees everything a
``MEMBER`` sees. ``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, and ``DELETE`` all require
``role = 'member'``, so a ``VIEWER`` membership can never change or destroy a
row even though nothing in the application yet creates viewers. The dormant
role is enforced by Postgres from day one, not bolted on later as a policy
migration. The literal is lowercase because Piccolo's ``Varchar(choices=...)``
stores an enum's *value*, not its name — these predicates and the Python
comparisons must agree on that casing, or every write would silently deny.

The per-command split is load-bearing, not stylistic. A single ``FOR ALL``
policy cannot express this: ``WITH CHECK`` constrains only the *new* row of
an ``INSERT`` or ``UPDATE``, and a ``DELETE`` has no new row, so the write
predicate would be ignored entirely and deletion would fall back to the
permissive read predicate in ``USING``. ``UPDATE`` also takes the write
predicate in ``USING``, so a viewer cannot even see the row to lock it and
the denial happens before any work.

Promotions are not content and carry their own policy: the row is a nonce
owned by one person, so :func:`promotion_statements` keys it on ownership
rather than on membership or role.

    Piccolo gives every table one surrogate primary key, has no syntax for
    multi-column uniqueness, and none for a partial index, so three
    constraints this schema genuinely depends on have to be stated here:
    ``memberships`` is keyed by the pair it stores, a page path is unique
    within its space, and a person owns at most one *personal* space while
    owning any number of shared ones. Losing any of them would let duplicates
    through that the application logic assumes cannot exist -- the last one
    most sharply, since a second personal space makes
    ``resolve_space(principal, "personal")`` ambiguous, which locks the person
    out of every tool call.
